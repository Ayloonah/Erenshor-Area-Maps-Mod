# Ayloonah's Erenshor Area Maps Mod
Adds the zone maps from [the Erenshor Wiki](https://erenshor.wiki.gg/wiki/Zone_Maps) to the game.

## Features
- When opening the world map, the zone map will be displayed instead, provided that one is available.
- If a zone area map is not available, the Wiki's world map will be displayed instead.
- A button to toggle between the zone map and the Wiki's world map is available in the bottom right corner of the map screen.
  - If there is no button, it would be because a zone map is unavailable. 

## Installation
- Requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)
- Download the zip file of the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Ayloonah/Erenshor-Area-Maps-Mod/releases/)
  - Lower quality assets are inlcuded in the release zip file. Feel free to download higher quality assets directly from this repo and replace the images from the mod's Assets folder with them.
- Place the whole `Ayloonah.Erenshor-Area-Maps-Mod` folder inside your `BepInEx/Plugins` directory
  - For example, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Erenshor\BepInEx\Plugins\Ayloonah.Erenshor-Area-Maps-Mod`

## Known quirks
- I'm sure there's a way to grab the zone map from the game, but I don't know how, so the Assets folder is currently required. If you know how to do it, feel free to reuse my code or to tell me so I can update ^^
- Some (if not all) area maps look squished as they are wider than the map window. I could most likely fix it, but didn't feel like it atm.
